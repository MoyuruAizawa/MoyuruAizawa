Hi there.  
I'm an Android Developer based in Tokyo.  

I develop UI libraries such as LazyTimetable, which makes it easy to create timetables for conferences and festivals using Jetpack Compose, and Cropify, a library for cropping images with Jetpack Compose.  
Previously, I also created TimetableLayout, a RecyclerView.LayoutManager implementation of LazyTimetable.
